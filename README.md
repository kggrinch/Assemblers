# Thumb-2 Implementation Work of Memory/Time-Related C Standard Library Functions

## Overview
A implementation of several functions of the C standard library using the Thumb-2 assembly language. The assembly language utilizes the Keil MDK ARM software development
environment, emulating in the ARM Cortex microcontroller on the Texas Instrucment TM4C series target device (TM4C1233H6PM).

## System Requirments
* Keil MDK-ARM (ÂµVision IDE)
* Device Family Pack (DFP) for TM4C
* Windows OS 7 or higher (32-bit or 64-bit).
